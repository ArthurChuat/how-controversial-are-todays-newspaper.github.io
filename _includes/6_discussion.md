#### Relayed topics in the press

By analysing the most important newspapers sellers in the UK, we have seen that the most relayed topics are the sports and team related ones. This underlines a huge interest for sports in the UK, and may explain why sports' players have such a high salary, which is because people pay to watch matches and read results. <br>
Also, by looking at the most important relayed topics, it can be seen that they vary from "Sports" to "Investing", passing by "Changemakers", and "Family" related topics. One very interesting subject that is not straightforward to understand is the reason why "Datetime" appears to be a famous topic in the news. One reason could be that date is always cited in speeches by citing past facts to explain and try to get its audience to adhere to their opinion .


#### Link between sales and controversy

As explained at the beginning, our goal was to see if we would be able to link the performance of a newspaper, here economic performance (sellings), to the usage of controversial subjects. In order to correlate the latter's we performed a linear regression, the results can be observed above. <br>
Well, the results did not fit our expectations. The expected results were a clear and direct correlation between sellings and the usage of controversy, here represented by our controversy score. One can observe that sellings do not increase with the controversy score, it is rather the opposite! There is a small decrease in sales for 11 out of 14 newspapers!
