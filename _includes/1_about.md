Controversy, as defined in the [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/controversy) dictionary is a ***"discussion marked especially by the expression of opposing views"***. As such, a topic that brings forth dispute and disagreement can be considered controversial, and by extension a newspaper prone to relating those kind of subject can be said to be controversial.

In this data story we will try to link the performance of a newspaper to the controversy of its published subjects. To do so, we analysed millions of quotes, from 2015 to 2020, which appeared in more than 150 millions English newspapers across the world.

The quotes were obtained from the [Quotebank](https://zenodo.org/record/4277311#.Ybp4UJGZNPY) corpus which is the fruit of more than a decade of data collection. This Web-scale dataset provides a significant quantity of quotations, each of them being associated to its author and the journals in which it appeared along with many more features. An example of quotations that can be obtained is the following:

***"I like [Rob West](http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/uk/entertainment/a27016252/kim-kardashian-baby-number-four-normal-name-family-tribute/), but not [Robert West](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/)  ."*** - Jimmy Kimmel
