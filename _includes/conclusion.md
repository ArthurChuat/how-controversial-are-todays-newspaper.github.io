Well, the results of the controversy score of a single topic are not too bad, the sub-topic “Trump” reacted to the numerous scandals that occurred during the year 2017. However, our controversy score does not really behave as the signature score already defined in the literature but the implementation of ours was easier.

The distribution of the topic for each newspaper represents correctly the most recurrent themes in the media and their area of expertise. As a final point, we do not get the expected results, but we can suggest that the usage of controversy does not increase sellings, perhaps even the opposite.

To finish with, we have dug into one of the most important features to explain sellings which is how newspapers choose to relay daily information. However, the controversy of each newspaper is not the only parameter that affects sellings. In fact, we could think of public opinon regarding daily information, perhaps because people are not willing to follow daily news, which would result in a drop in sellings.

Another factor could be that today people can access news through YouTube videos, social media or other kind of media outlet. Even though these previous factors seem to influence negatively newspapers' sellings, population growth attenuates this decrease. Thus, all these variables have a certain impact on sellings, so it is hard to draw a significant conclusion if, whether or not, relaying controversial news impact sellings positively or negatively.
